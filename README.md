# Code-Refactor
The attached html and CSS files show the refactoring that was done to shorten a repetitive file. The HTML was also made more accessible as semantic tags were added to assist in understanding how the page is divided.  

Below are some screenshots of the refactoring and edits that were done to fit DRY standards.

Alt tags were also added to describe the images with some collaboration with Sean overy as he we shared how each of us described the photos on the webpage.

The apperance of the webpage remained the same.
